# Bamazon-Store-Front
Store front application created with MySQL and Node.js
 ```
Welcome to Bamazon, a storefront built with MySQL and Node.js. 

A user can view an inventory list; choose an item they like to purchase by 
typing in the products ID along with the quantity. However, if we do not have 
enough of the selected item in stock, the system tells the user we are unable 
to fulfill their purchase, and the transaction is terminated.
